Redefining your editorial workflow.

== Description ==

Edit Flow offers a suite of functionality to redefine your editorial workflow within WordPress. Features include:

* Custom Statuses - Create any number of custom statuses to define the stages of your editorial workflow. By default, Edit Flow adds "Assigned", "Pitch", and "Waiting for Feedback" to WordPress' default "Draft" and "Pending Review".
* Editorial Comments - Threaded commenting in the WordPress admin on every post for discussion about the production of a given piece of content. This can cutdown on long-winded back-and-forth email threads as all comments are conveniently displayed within the Edit Post page.
* Email Notifications - Receive email notifications for new editorial comments or when a post changes status. Notifications are delivered to admins and the post author by default, but any users that comment on posts will receive follow up email notifications.
* Usergroups - Similar to roles, usergroups provice a way to group users that perform similar roles in your organization. At the moment, usergroups can be subscribed to posts so that all members receive post updates.
* Calendar - View all of your upcoming posts on a week-by-week calendar, and filter by post status, category, or user.
* Editorial Metadata - Define custom editorial metadata to be attached to every post. Admins can add editorial metadata like "contact information", "assignment description", "due date", or "location" using the following field types: checkbox, date, location, paragraph, text, or user dropdown.
* Story Budget - View all of your upcoming posts in a more traditional story budget view. Posts are grouped by category, and view can be filtered by post status, category, user, or limited to a date range. Hit the print button to take it on the go.

More details and documentation can be found on the [Edit Flow website](http://www.editflow.org/)

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install this plugin is to go to Add New in the Plugins section of your blog admin and search for "Edit Flow." On the far right side of the search results, click "Install."

If the automatic process above fails, follow these simple steps to do a manual install:

1. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Write and enjoy the merits of a structured editorial workflow!

== Screenshots ==

1. The ability to Add, Edit, and Delete Custom Statuses
2. Custom Statuses are automatically added to Status dropdown on the Edit Post and Quick Edit Post screens
3. A new column is added to the Edit Posts screen and the ability to filter by status
4. Threaded editorial commenting and additional metadata for posts
5. See posts your upcoming posts on the Calendar
6. Get a sense of your upcoming content on the Story Budget
7. Editorial metadata comes with a bunch of built-in terms, but these can be changed to your heart's content
8. Within each post you can modify the metadata recorded for the post

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I get an error like 'Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR' on activation? =

Edit Flow requires PHP5+ to work and you're probably not on PHP5. Talk to your hosting provider and hop on the PHP5 bandwagon. It's awesome.

= I don't like the preset roles that are able to view the calendar. How can I edit them? =

There are two ways you can do this. One is to put something like the following code in your functions.php file:

`add_filter( 'ef_view_calendar_cap', 'change_editflows_stupid_default_caps' );

function change_editflows_stupid_default_caps( $cap ) {
	return 'edit_posts';
}`
This will allow anyone with the capability to edit posts to view the calendar. See other capabilities you could use [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Capability_vs._Role_Table).

The other option is to install a role management plugin, like Justin Tadlock's excellent [Members plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/), and let the plugin do the heavy lifting of customizing the roles and capabilities to your heart's content.

= Edit Flow doesn't do X, Y, and Z. That makes me sad. =

== Other Notes ==

= Custom Post Type Support =

As of v0.6.1, we have added custom post type support for almost all features in Edit Flow. By default, post and pages have most features enabled.

You can add features to other post types one of two ways. (Note: the code below should be called in the init hook for best results.)

* Option 1: supports arg in register_post_type

`
register_post_type( 'event', array( 
	supports( 'title', 'ef_notifications' )
) );
`

* Option 2: add_post_type_support

`
add_post_type_support( 'event', 'ef_notifications' ); 
`

You can also remove support for features using the `remove_post_type_support` function.

= List of Features =

You can add / remove the following features to post types:

* ef_custom_statuses
* ef_notifications
* ef_editorial_comments
* ef_calendar
* ef_editorial_metadata

= Editorial Comments =

**Hiding comments from front-end**

*Update (2010-02-11):* You no longer have to worry about hiding editorial comments if Edit Flow is ever disabled. Edit Flow will automatically show (in the admin) and hide (in the front-end) editorial comments on activation/deactivation.

**Threaded Commenting**

For replies to work properly, you need to enable threaded commenting in your blog's settings. Find it under **Settings > Discussion** and enable the setting called **Enable threaded (nested) comments**.

= Disabling Specific Notifications =

You can disable different types of notifications. You might want to do this, for example, if you don't use custom statuses but rely heavily on editorial comments.

The following code snippet disables post status change notifications but maintains editorial comment notifications:

`add_filter( 'ef_notification_editorial_comment', '__return_false' );`

Here's a full list of notification types that can be disabled:
* ef_notification_status_change
* ef_notification_{$post_type}_status_change (where `{$post_type}` is the type of post, e.g. ef_notification_newsletter_status_change)
* ef_notification_editorial_comment
